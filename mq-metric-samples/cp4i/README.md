# Monitoring metrics in Cloud Pak for Integration

## Using sample yamls

This directory contains sample files that show how to deploy the Prometheus monitor to expose queue metrics for a queue
manager running in a Cloud Pak for Integration deployment on Red Hat OpenShift. The samples are accompanied by the blog
post
[Monitoring IBM MQ queue depth in Cloud Pak for Integration](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/integration/blogs/matt-roberts1/2021/05/03/monitoring-mq-qdepth-cp4i)
which provides a worked tutorial illustrating how to implement monitoring scenarios in a Cloud Pak for Integration
deployment.

The MQ Certified Container that comes in the Cloud Pak for Integration emits a range of
[queue manager (server) scope metrics](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-mq/latest?topic=operator-metrics-published-when-using-mq)
but does not currently offer an option to publish information about queues or topics, so use of an additional Prometheus
monitor pod as shown below allows queue (and topic) metrics to be published to Prometheus for consumption by OpenShift
monitoring tools.

The steps to do this are as follows;

```
# Build the Prometheus monitor container as normal
cd mq-metric-samples/scripts
./buildRuntime.sh mq_prometheus

# Tag and push the Docker image to the container registry used by your OpenShift cluster
docker tag mq-metric-prometheus:5.2.0 your.repo/your-namespace/mq-metric-prometheus:1.0 docker push
your.repo/your-namespace/mq-metric-prometheus:1.0

# Create a ConfigMap and Secret to configure the settings that you wish to apply to your monitor.
# Update these to suit your requirements
oc create configmap metrics-configuration \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_CONNECTION_QUEUEMANAGER='QM1' \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_CONNECTION_CONNNAME='quickstart-cp4i-ibm-mq(1414)' \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_CONNECTION_CHANNEL='SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN' \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_OBJECTS_QUEUES='*,!SYSTEM.*,!AMQ.*' \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_OBJECTS_SUBSCRIPTIONS='!$SYS*' \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_OBJECTS_TOPICS='!*' \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_GLOBAL_USEPUBLICATIONS=false \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_GLOBAL_USEOBJECTSTATUS=true \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_GLOBAL_CONFIGURATIONFILE='' \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_GLOBAL_LOGLEVEL=INFO

oc create secret generic metrics-credentials \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_CONNECTION_USER='dummyuser' \
    --from-literal=IBMMQ_CONNECTION_PASSWORD='dummypassword'



# Use the samples in this directory to deploy the Prometheus container to OpenShift
cd mq-metric-samples/cp4i

# Create a new ServiceAccount that will ensure the metrics pod is
# deployed using the most secure Restricted SCC
oc apply -f sa-pod-deployer.yaml

# Update the spec.containers.image attribute in metrics-pod.yaml to match
# your container registry and image name using a text editor
vi metrics-pod.yaml

# Deploy the metrics pod using the service account
oc apply -f ./metrics-pod.yaml --as=my-service-account

# Create a Service object that exposes the metrics pod so that it can
# be discovered by monitoring tools that are looking for Prometheus endpoints
#
# Note that the spec.selector.app matches the metadata.labels.app property
# defined in metrics-pod.yaml
oc apply -f ./metrics-service.yaml
```


Once the metrics pod is deployed you can see it in action by looking at the logs for the pod, and the "IBMMQ Collect"
statements showing that the metrics are being scraped by the Prometheus agent running in your OpenShift cluster.
```
oc logs mq-metric-prometheus

## Helm Charts

The `chart` directory contains all the helm charts needed to deploy the set of resources on an OpenShift cluster.

In this case the pod is wrapped in a deployment resource and an OpenShift route is added to provide access to the
metrics application.
